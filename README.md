# Chip8
### Chip 8 Emulator in Java
#### This Emulator was made to further practice my Java skills.
Creation of this project gave me a better understanding of bitwise operations and CPU processing. I would like to add more to this
emulator and even launch it to different applications.

### Things to do:

Allow android compatiblity.

Allow IOS compatibility.
