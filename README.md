# Chip8 Emulator in Java
Built using JavaFX

### What is the Chip8?

>CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, 
developed by Joseph Weisbecker. 
It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 
1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. 
CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. 
It was made to allow video games to be more easily 
programmed for these computers

The Chip8 emulator supports additional ROM files as tha application
allows for a user menu prompt to load a rom. Upon load users will initially
be present with the classic game known as PONG. Have fun playing some
classic retro games!
